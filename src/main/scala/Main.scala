Weekly Coding Challenge:

Problem 1: Given two Strings A and B. Find the length of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of the given Strings. Input: A = Minneapolis, B = Minnesota.

Problem 2: Write java Program to Find Smallest and Largest Element in an Array.
Note: Number can not be repeated in the array.

For example:
1
2
3
4
5
6

int[] arr1={7,5,6,1,4,2};
Missing number : 3
int[] arr2={5,3,1,2};
Missing number : 4

Logical Reasoning:
3) This question is based on a certain code language. Understand the logic in the coding and answer the following question.

If PROCESSOR is coded as D4F3C5C1E1S1S1E3C6, what is the code for QUADRANT?

r - f3 - 6*3 - 18
o - c5 - 3*5 - 15
c - c1 - 3*1 - 3
e - e1 - 5*1 - 5
s - s1 - 19*1 - 19
s - s1 - 19*1 - 19
o - e3 - 5*3 - 15
r - c6 - 3*6 - 18

q - 17 - 17*1 - q1
u - 21 - 7*3 - c7
a - 1 - 1*1 - a1
d - 4 - 2*2 - b2
